# HADomotics

**Interactive home floor plan addon for Home Assistant**

HADomotics lets you upload a drawing of your home and place interactive buttons, lights, sensors, and indicators directly on the image. Everything is manageable from the addon's built-in configuration panel, and a Lovelace custom card displays your home plan with live entity states.

---

## Features

- 🏠 **Multi-floor support** – pre-configured floors for *Floor 1*, *Floor 2*, and *Garden*; add as many custom floors as you need
- 🖼️ **Floor plan images** – upload any JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, or SVG image as the background for each floor
- 🖱️ **Visual element placement** – click directly on the image to drop a new element (button, light, sensor, indicator, climate, cover, camera)
- ⚙️ **Rich element configuration** – set label, entity ID, icon (MDI), tap action, colors (on/off), and pixel dimensions
- 🔄 **Drag & resize** – reposition and resize elements by dragging them on the canvas
- 📊 **Real-time states** – the Lovelace card reflects live HA entity states and allows toggling with a single click
- 🎨 **Custom Lovelace card** – drop-in `hadomotics-card` custom element with multi-floor tab navigation

## Lovelace card

Add the following to a Lovelace dashboard YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:hadomotics-card
title: My Home
addon_url: http://homeassistant.local:8099
default_floor: floor1   # optional – ID of the floor to show by default
```

| Property | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `addon_url` | ✅ | Base URL of the HADomotics addon |
| `title` | | Card title (default: `HADomotics`) |
| `default_floor` | | Floor ID to select on load |

### Floor IDs

The default floors have IDs `floor1`, `floor2`, and `garden`.
Custom floors get a UUID as their ID – you can see it by inspecting the API at `http://<addon>/api/floors`.
